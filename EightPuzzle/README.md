# 8 Puzzle Game State Space Visualizer

The 8 Puzzle Game State Space Visualizer is a tool created to visualize the state search algorithm for solving the classic "8 Puzzle". The **8-Puzzle Game** is a sliding puzzle that challenges players to rearrange numbered tiles on a grid to solve the puzzle. The goal is to move the tiles from an initial scrambled state to a target state by sliding tiles into the empty space.
